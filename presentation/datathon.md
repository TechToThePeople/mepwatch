# The crisis
### European democracy is at a crossroads
Citizens are increasingly disconnected from EU-level policy making. Election turnout is low. 
Fake news and voter manipulations thrive on social media.
Euroscepticism is on the rise. 
Corporate capture obscures democratic processes.

---
# The solution
Democracy works if citizens are informed and engaged.
Technology can lower the barrier to engaging meaningfully in European politics, make information accessible, improve transparency and make it easy for citizens to feed back and hold their representatives accountable for their promises - and their votes.

# The stages
First: single vote campaigns build engagement and pressure
Second: learning and tweaking
Third: complex multi-vote scorecards inform and engage citizens in pre-election campaigning

[blah blah we consulted with stakeholders and users, judged appetite and needs now and in the future, adopted a testing approach]
