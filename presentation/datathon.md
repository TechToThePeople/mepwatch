### informed citizens = better democracy
notes:
MEPwatch is about bringing data and facts back into European policits, and briging the gaps between citizens, campaigning organisations and politicians who represent all of us in the European Parliament.
What’s in this presentation:
- we go through the why we need this tool, what’s the purpose of it, who it’s for, and how to use it

# The crisis
#### European democracy at a crossroads
![crisis](crisis.png)
notes:
- citizens increasingly disconnected from EU policy making. 
- election turnout low. 
- fake news and voter manipulations on social media.
- euroscepticism on the rise. 
- corporate capture obscuring democratic processes.

# The solution
Democracy works if citizens are informed and engaged.
![solution](solution.png)
notes:
Technology and can **lower the barrier** to engaging meaningfully in European politics, make **information accessible** and easier to digest in a world where we’re overwhelmed with it at all times, **improve transparency** and make it easy for citizens to feed back and hold their representatives **accountable** for their promises  and their votes.

![tool](tool.png)
notes:
What we’re doing is providing a tool for campaigning organisations to get active, and get their constituencies *followers, subscribers, members* also active in European politics.

# The stages
1. single vote campaigns build engagement and pressure
2. learning and tweaking
3. complex multi-vote scorecards inform and engage citizens in pre-election campaigning

notes:
We are still a few months away from the elections and now is the time to activate citizens across the EU on some key topics, without waiting until the last moment. This is why we’ve developed the app in a way that is the most useful right now and we are collecting information and contacting potential users to get their experiences, needs and crowdsource vote information.
