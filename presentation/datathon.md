#### European democracy at a crossroads
![crisis](crisis.png)
notes:
- citizens increasingly disconnected from EU policy making. 
- election turnout low. 
- fake news and voter manipulations on social media.
- euroscepticism on the rise. 
- corporate capture obscuring democratic processes.

# The solution
Democracy works if citizens are informed and engaged.

notes:
Technology can lower the barrier to engaging meaningfully in European politics, make information accessible, improve transparency and make it easy for citizens to feed back and hold their representatives accountable for their promises - and their votes.
